\section{Multiplexing Technique}
Multiplexing is achieved by connecting all inputs of the seven-segment displays to a single BCD. Digital pins are connected to the common cathode/anode of each display, allowing selective activation of each display to show the BCD output. The displays are alternated with a very small time gap, creating the illusion of simultaneous operation.
